		 * We know to create a mutable list we use:
		 *  1. ArrayList
		 *  2. LinkedList
		 *  3. Vector
		 *  
		 *  The basic data structure used under ArrayList & Vector is Arrays.
		 *  However, for LinkedList basic data structure is LinkedList.
		 *  
		 *  Insertion & Deletion of elements in Arrays are slower, while searching for element is
		 *  less time consuming and provide constant time access. 
		 *  
		 *  Elements in LinkedList are doubly linked forward & backward
		 *  Iteration is slower than ArrayList. Faster Insertion and Deletion
		 *  
		 *  When to Use ArrayList: When you have very few Insertions and Deletions and very few modifications
		 *  in the list and want to access the elements based on their positions, we would go for ArrayList
		 *  
		 *  When to Use LinkedList: If there are numbers of Insertions and Deletions we would go for 
		 *  LinkedList
